<b>Introduction</b>
</font>

<p>Teams working on H/FOSS projects and individuals doing non-honors research projects will deliver a presentation on their year's work during the final exam period for the course. For students doing honors projects their public defense will serve as the final presentation for the senior seminar.

<p>The Final Presentation will be a 20 minute oral presentation of the year's work followed by 10 minutes of question and answer. Clearly it will not be possible to fully present everything that you have done in full detail in only 20 minutes.  Thus, you should think carefully about the story you would like to tell and what information you need to include to tell it, as well as what can be omitted. You will want to select the content and level of detail for each topic so that the target audience is able to follow everything that you discuss. Overall your goal is to give the audience a good high-level understanding of the richness and scope of your work and experiences along with a clear understanding of the deep details on one or a few technical aspects of the work. 

<p>At a minimum, you should explain your project, its purpose and uses, the community it serves, contextualize and list your accomplishments, demonstrate and give deeper technical details about one or a few of these accomplishments, reflect on your key experiences with the project and the community, the most significant challenges you faced and how you overcame them and the most important things you have learned both technically and otherwise.  

<p>The Final Presentation will be counted as the presentation portion of the final Project Checkpoint. The grading criterion for the Final Presentation will the the same as is given in the Project Checkpoint rubric on the <a href="syllabus.html">Course Syllabus</a>.

<b>Audience</b>
</font>

<p>The full department and the broader college community will be invited to the final presentations.  Your Final Presentation should be prepared for a target audience of your peers (junior/senior undergraduate computer science majors). However, you should assume that they do not have any prior knowledge of the specific project on which you are working or what you have done. It may be helpful to imagine preparing your presentation such that a class of seniors from another similar college could attend and understand what you have done.
