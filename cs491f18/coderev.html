<b>Introduction</b>
</font>

<p>Code reviews are a common industry practice. This exercise will give you a small glimpse into what a code review might be like.  You will present to the class a small piece of challenging code. The code should be short enough to be explained in the time allotted and will typically have been written or edited by you as part of your project. Ideally the code will also contain some interesting or difficult features that represent a programming challenge that you overcame or something new that you learned about. If that is not possible due to the nature of your project or the work you have completed please consult with the professor to determine a suitable alternative.

<b>Presentation Details</b>
</font>

<p>Your presentation may use only the application and an editor (or IDE). The length of the presentation will depend upon the number of students in the class and will bee communicated to the class in advance of the assignment. You should very quickly contextualize the code so that the audience understands the role the code plays in the application. The remainder of the presentation should discuss the structure and function of the code, the challenges that you faced, the solution you found and/or what you learned.  You will need to be explicit in differentiating the code you have written from code written by others that is included or that you have edited/modified.

<b>Grading</b>
</font>

<p>I will assess code reviews using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a &#x2713;.  Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a &#x2713;+ or down to 0 or &#x2713;-.
